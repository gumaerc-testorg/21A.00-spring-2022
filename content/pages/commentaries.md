Of the 10 prompts for 2-page (double-spaced) reading commentaries, students will select 2 each quarter (4 total). These short papers should address specific passages or sections of the readings (include page numbers for any quotations), and will serve as the basis for discussion throughout the semester. To facilitate discussion this should be submitted by 10 AM on the session date.

**Session 4 Commentary paper**

Compare the experiences of cultural contact described in *The Dawn of Everything* with the “[First Contact](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085544/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4).” With allowances made for different historical circumstances, what similarities do you notice? Is there evidence of an indigenous critique?

**Session 6 Commentary paper**

How does the discussion of “political self-consciousness” in *The Dawn of Everything* apply to the events in “[Joe Leahy’s Neighbours](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460476/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)”? What different models of politics and personhood do various parties in the film embrace?

**Session 7 Commentary paper**

How do the anthropological research methods in described in today’s readings compare to research methods you’ve encountered in other disciplines? What are the distinctive empirical advantages and challenges of these methods?

**Session 9 Commentary paper**

How do Graeber and Wengrow’s analyses of egalitarianism, autonomy, and private property connect to the events depicted in “[Black Harvest](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103817/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)”?

**Session 11 Commentary paper**

Use one or more concepts from Durkheim to explain how internet memes work, as seen in the case of Baby Forklift and/or Pepe the Frog.

**Session 15 Commentary paper**

Conduct a ritual self-inventory. Spend a day keeping track of the formal and informal rituals you engage in. How do you tell the difference between ritual and everything else, and what difference does it make?

**Session 17 Commentary paper**

What kinds of theories of culture can you find on display at the [Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology](https://peabody.harvard.edu/home)? Do you notice any tensions between competing theories?

**Session 19 Commentary paper**

Recall Graeber and Wengrow’s discussion (pp. 116–17) of two aspects of ritual: subverting established order and asserting established order. With reference to one or both of this week’s readings, describe how expressive practices (ritual, art, and performance) can function as a mode of resistance. How is that different from political protest?

**Session 21 Commentary paper**

Reflecting on this week’s readings and our conversation with James Shen, discuss why the city is so important for understanding humanity’s past, present and future.

**Session 23 Commentary paper**

*The* *Dawn of Everything* ends on a note of optimism about humanity’s prospects for “getting unstuck” from restrictive/repressive social formations. Does “[Nomadland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9770150/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)” reflect that optimism, or does it suggest a bleaker vision?
